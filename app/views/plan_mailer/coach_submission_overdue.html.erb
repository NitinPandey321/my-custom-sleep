  <p>Hello Coach <strong><%= @coach.last_name %></strong>,</p>

  <p>
    This is an automated priority alert. The proof submitted by
    <strong><%= @client.full_name %></strong> has remained unreviewed for over
    <strong><%= @elapsed_hours %> hours</strong>.

    As our clients are medical professionals working high-stress shifts, they rely
    on rapid feedback to adjust their daily pillars. Delayed feedback can disrupt
    their biological timing and decrease engagement with the program.

    Please review the pending submission immediately to maintain our service standard
    and ensure the client remains on track with their recovery plan.
