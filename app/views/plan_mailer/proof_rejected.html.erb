    Dear <strong>Dr. <%= @user.last_name %></strong>,
  </p>

  <p>
    Your recent proof submission for the
    <strong><%= @pillar_name %></strong> module has been reviewed, but was not approved.
  </p>

  <p>
    No worries — your coach has shared feedback so you can adjust and upload again.
    These refinements are part of the journey toward stronger recovery habits.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
    <strong>Next Step:</strong><br>
    Review the comments and re-upload your proof when you’re ready.
  </p>

  <%= render "mailers/shared/button",

  <p style="margin-top: 25px;">
    You’ve got this,<br>
