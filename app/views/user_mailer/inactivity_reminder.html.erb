    Dear <strong><%= @user.last_name %></strong>,

    We hope you’re doing well. We noticed it’s been a little while since you logged into the app and continued your personalized sleep journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    We completely understand—long shifts and busy schedules can pull your attention away. When you’re ready, your plan is waiting, and we’ll guide you every step of the way.
